# Disclaimer
This package follows the example of the `exams` package. The goal is to provide an easy and seamless way to generate individualised exams for students that can either be solved on paper or online.


# Why a new package
The `exams` package is well established and there are a number of good references including a talk at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnyCR7q4P4Q. To the best of my very limited knowledge, the `exams` package does not provide to generate exams in the Rmd format, such that they can be handed out to students.
